**Instructions:**

You will be provided with three pieces of information:

1. **Sub-Program Goal:** A concise statement describing what the sub-program aims to achieve.
2. **Sub-Program Summary:** A brief overview of the sub-program, including its key activities and intended outcomes.
3. **Main Program Definition:** A central definition of the overarching program that the sub-program is intended to support. This definition outlines the core purpose and goals of the main program.

Your task is to analyze the alignment of the Sub-Program Goal and Summary with the Main Program Definition through a two-step process:

**Step 1: Main Program Goal Formulation:**

Based on the provided Main Program Definition, formulate *three distinct goals* of the main program.  These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) where possible, or at least clearly defined and distinguishable from each other.  Express these goals in concise and actionable statements.

**Step 2: Sub-Program Alignment Check:**

Analyze whether the Sub-Program Goal and Summary align with the three goals you formulated in Step 1.  Assess the degree of overlap and identify which of the main program's goals are addressed by the sub-program.

**Scoring:**

Assign a score based on the following scale:

* **5 - Completely Identical Goals:** The Sub-Program Goal and Summary perfectly align with all three of the Main Program Goals you formulated. The sub-program's intended outcomes are completely identical to the desired results of the main program.
* **4 - Mostly Identical Goals:** The Sub-Program Goal and Summary align closely with all three of the Main Program Goals. There might be minor variations in phrasing or scope, but the core objectives are essentially the same.
* **3 - Some Overlapping Goals:** The Sub-Program Goal and Summary align with some (but not all) of the Main Program Goals you formulated.  There is a clear overlap in some areas, but other goals of the main program are not addressed by the sub-program.
* **2 - Few Overlapping Goals:** The Sub-Program Goal and Summary align with only a few of the Main Program Goals. The overlap is limited, and the sub-program addresses only a small portion of the main program's overall objectives.
* **1 - Almost No Overlap:** The Sub-Program Goal and Summary show almost no alignment with the Main Program Goals you formulated. There is minimal overlap, and the sub-program's focus is significantly different from the main program's objectives.

**Output Format:**

Provide your response in the following json format and make sure the json is valid:

```json
{{
    "score": [Your Score (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1)],
    "justification": [A concise explanation of your score, referencing specific elements from the Sub-Program Goal, Sub-Program Summary, and the Main Program Goals you formulated. Clearly state which main program goals are addressed, partially addressed, or not addressed at all by the sub-program. Explain *why* you chose the score you did, providing evidence for your assessment.]
}}
```

**Example Input:**

```
Sub-Program Goal: To improve the digital literacy skills of senior citizens.
Sub-Program Summary: This sub-program will offer free computer classes to senior citizens, focusing on internet safety, email communication, and basic software applications.
Main Program Definition: To bridge the digital divide and ensure equitable access to technology and digital skills for all citizens.
```

**Example Output:**

```json
{{
    "score": "4",
    "justification": "The Sub-Program Goal and Summary strongly align with Main Program Goal 2 (enhancing digital literacy and skills). The computer classes focusing on internet safety, email, and software directly contribute to this goal. While access (Goal 1) is implied by providing the classes, it's not explicitly stated that the sub-program addresses access to technology itself.  Goal 3 (participation in the digital economy) is not directly addressed by the sub-program's activities.  Therefore, while there's strong alignment with one key goal and some implicit connection to another, the sub-program doesn't fully address all three goals, resulting in a score of 4."
